Simple DQN implementation for Atari's discrete action space. <br>
Algorithm from: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236.

Simply run `python train.py`. 
- The agent should learn to play Breakout in about 2 hrs.
- Expert level performance takes a few more hours.
- Also provided trained model checkpoints for breakout and pong after about a million gradient steps
